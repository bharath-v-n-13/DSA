# 🚀 Daily DSA Challenge

👋 Welcome to my **Daily DSA Problem Solving** journey!<br>  
I'm committed to solving **one LeetCode problem every day** to sharpen my problem-solving skills, enhance my logic, and become better at coding interviews. 🧠💻<br>

---

## 📌 Objective
To build consistency and confidence in **Data Structures and Algorithms** by solving **real-world problems** daily.<br>
Improving speed, accuracy, and depth of understanding with each challenge.<br>

---

## 🛠️ Platform
Problems are picked mainly from:<br>
🔹 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) <br>
🔹 [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) (occasionally)<br>

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered So Far
- Arrays<br>
- Strings<br>
- Linked Lists<br>
- HashMaps<br>
- Recursion<br>
- Binary Search<br>
- Two Pointers<br>
- Stack & Queue<br>
- Sliding Window (coming soon...)<br>

---

## 🔥 How I Approach Each Problem
1. **Understand the problem** clearly (no assumptions!)<br>
2. **Break down the logic** and choose the best DSA technique<br>
3. **Code the solution** and handle edge cases<br>
4. **Optimize** where possible and analyze time & space complexity<br>
5. **Document the approach** for future reference<br>
